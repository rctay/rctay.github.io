# Getting started with private keys on smartcards

I found these guides to be useful when I was getting started:

- <https://raymii.org/s/articles/Nitrokey_Start_Getting_started_guide.html>

  Targets the particular hardware I'm using, the Nitrokey Start.

- <https://www.gniibe.org/memo/software/gpg/keygen-25519.html>

  Ed25519 keys are relatively new. The console logs, coupled with the author's comments, made this very useful.

- <https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair>

  Covers the lifecycle of keys from generating, backing up, and revoking them (in the worst case scenario!).

- <https://shankarkulumani.com/2019/03/gpg.html>

  Useful usage examples for signing, encrypting, etc.

# setup on mac

- Use pinentry, a nice UI for pin entry. Otherwise the curses[^curses] password entry
  unexpectedly waits for password in some other terminal (namely the one you
  started gpg-agent in...)

  ```console
  $ brew install gpg pinentry-mac
  $ echo pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
  ```

[^curses]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)>

# usage

- For the first time on a new computer,

  ```console
  $ gpg --recv-keys C0023FA0
  $ mkdir $(gpgconf --list-dirs homedir)
  $ printf "pinentry-program %s\n" "$(which pinentry-mac)" >> $(gpgconf --list-dirs homedir)/gpg-agent.conf
  ```

- To start running ssh operations,

  ```console
  # start daemon
  $ gpg --card-edit
  # tell ssh to use gpg as the authentication agent
  $ export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)"
  # check
  $ ssh-add -l
  256 SHA256:11112222aaaabbbb11112222aaaa4EF+qbZw/JZ5OYU cardno:FFFE12345566 (ED25519)
  ```

- If wonky,

  ```console
  $ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
  $ gpg --card-edit
  ```

# on Windows

- Setup gpg-agent:

  ```console
  $ echo enable-putty-support > $APPDATA/gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
  ```
- Start gpg-agent daemon

  ```console
  $ gpg --card-edit
  ...
  > quit
  ```
- Accept host key in PuTTY

  ```console
  $ plink git@github.com
  ```
- tell git to use plink:

  ```console
  GIT_SSH_COMMAND=plink git clone git@github.com:...
  ```

# using side-by-side with Krypton

Krypton sets up `~/.ssh/config`. We need to tell `git` to use `ssh` without that config file, via `-F`.

```console
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null' git clone git@github.com:...
```
