# Term: number of entropy bits of a password

- a concept from information theory
- a password with 5 bits of strength == 5 bits chosen randomly via coin tosses
  - would need 2^5 number attempts to exhaust all possibilities
  - on average, an attacker will have to try half of all possibilities

# Question: what is the recommended number of entropy bits?

- RFC 4086 "Randomness Requirements for Security

- Depends on threat model
  - 29 bits: only online attacks
  - 96 bits: important cryptographic keys
