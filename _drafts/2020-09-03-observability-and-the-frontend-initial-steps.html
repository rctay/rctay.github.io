# Observability, frontend

Note:
Observability is popular right now in the world of microservices. For those of us working on user-facing web applications, we might have a JavaScript frontend in, say, React or Angular, that fires off calls to those systems. But, despite being the starting point of backend work, there aren't any integrations on the browser-side, compared to the backend side of things (eg. Spring, ASP.NET Core). In this talk, I'll walk through the pieces you need for Wavefront integration on the browser-side. If anything, just come for the pretty graphs!

Agenda:
- Introduction

- How to do it?
  - backend setup
    - you can see requests to external systems, eg. Google authentication
  - frontend setup
    1. track it via a context
    2. report it
    3. propagate it

- What does it look like?

- hopefully this opens

Further work:
- What should I instrument?
- Why do I need observability?
- What makes a good trace?
- wavefront over zipkin / prometheus?
  - in the first place, what are the latter?

# Introduction


## What is observability?


## Monitoring = Observability?


## Monitoring
- identify symptoms of a problem ("error rate is up")
- USE: utilization (free memory), saturation (CPU run queue length), errors
- RED: request rate, error rate, duration of request


## Observability

# Walkthrough


## What you'll need

- A Wavefront instance: https://vmware.wavefront.com/
- API key: https://vmware.wavefront.com/userprofile/apiaccess


## Backend: the easy part

![Table of Wavefront SDKs]({{ "/public/img/2020-09-03-observability-and-the-frontend-initial-steps/Wavefront-sdks-table.png" | relative_url}}) <!-- .element: style="max-width: 60%" -->


- Pretty straightforward, pick the appropriate SDK for your backend
- Wire it up to the Wavefront instance and API key

Note:
I'll first start with the easy part, which is wiring up the backend.


Out-of-the-box:
- report an incoming API request as a span
- report an outgoing HTTP calls as a span
- (bonus) metrics eg. request rate, errors


- correlate those spans to a parent span
- propagation in OpenTracing terminology
- we'll need to set these headers when making an API request

```
wf-ot-...
```


## Frontend: the hard part

What do we need?
- Identify unit of work to be a trace/span
- Create a trace/span
- Report that trace/span to Wavefront
- Associate that trace/span with related work


### Identify unit of work to be a trace/span

![Example of trace and spans from Wavefront]({{ "/public/img/2020-09-03-observability-and-the-frontend-initial-steps/wavefront-tracing_trace_spans.png" | relative_url}})


### Trace

> A trace shows you how a particular request propagates through your application or among a set of services.

eg. shopping request


### Span

> A...trace consists of one or more spans, which are the individual segments of work in the trace.

eg. Printing.printShirts, Packaging.giftWrap


### Navigations

- Routing (in your favourite framework)
  - `@angular/router`
  - `react-router-dom`
- `/welcome`: start one trace/span
- `/about`: start another trace/span

The inspiration for this.

### Report that trace/span to Wavefront

### Associate that trace/span with related work

# Conclusion

Note:
Hopefully you are now able to have a more complete picture of work in your system.
