# Abstract

Software development teams across every industry are tasked with delivering applications, APIs and experiences that provide value to hundreds, thousands, or even millions of users every day. How can these teams deliver consistently and with confidence that their product <ins>functions properly</ins> and is compliant with any standards of <ins>quality or security</ins> that is important to them? Enter the CI/CD pipeline: a core tool that any software development team should use to <ins>automate</ins> the build, test, and deploy cycle for their product from code push all the way to Production.

Join our practitioners from VMware Tanzu Labs as they discuss some of the common pitfalls you may encounter when developing a CI/CD pipeline, and how to mitigate risk. We’ll be addressing the following in the webinar:
- What does an ideal pipeline look like?
- Who holds a stake in how these pipelines are created and what they do?
- How can we work together to ensure everyone's goals are achieved?

We look forward to your joining us.

# Agenda

* Introduction

  * Why should organizations use Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment?

    * Organizations that were practicing CI/CD were also the same ones observed to have: (Dora 2015)
      1. Lower levels of deployment pain (fear, disruptive)
      2. Higher levels of throughput (deployment frequency and deployment lead time) and stability (mean time to recover)
      3. Lower change fail rates (% of changes that fail when rolled out)
    * Organizations with higher levels of throughput and stability were 2x more likely to exceed productivity, market share, profitability goals. (Dora 2014)

  * (definitions of CI and CD - see Dora 2014 p16)

  * How to tell if Continuous Delivery is being used?

    * ❌ tool A, tool B
    * (Dora 2018) 1. Teams can deploy on-deman to production ...
    * 2. Fast feedback on the quality and deployability of the system is available to everyone on the team ...
